A better modular LISP-esque parser

Never mind, this is a worse LISP-esque parser. Basically, I'm storing things as strings, and that means that I can't keep track of as much information about those things as I want to. I'll eventually get around to writing a better Python LISP parser, but for now I'm shelving this.
